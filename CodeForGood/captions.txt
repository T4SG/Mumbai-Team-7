Hi, I am Anna, I lost my home, school and family. It was because of something everyone called a disaster.

Many people from the first response came and built us a temporary home, gave us food, clothing and medicines.

The first response helped us and in a few days, went back. But they forgot to build me a school. 

I want to study in a good school, grow up to become a smart and educated person.

Happy hearts came to our rescue !

Few months later I saw my school - which was a debris, being rebuilt. This brought me and many other kids in town some joy. 

You, our donors bring in hope for children like us, provide us oppurtunities to complete our education and move ahead in life !
